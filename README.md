# mlcl_theme
A blueprint for molecuel themes and frontend applications based on molecuel

***

mlcl_theme is a blueprint for molecuel themes. It ships as a build framework for frontend applications to ease the composition of frontend libraries and their dependencies. mlcl_theme is based on the "opinionated kickstarter" ngbp (https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) adopted for the use within the mlcl infrastructure: less css generation, bower js integration, grunt workflows, layouts & templates based on handlebars packed into a best practice directory structure.
